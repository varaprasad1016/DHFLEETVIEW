//! Device discovery: finding supported COM devices (currently the Lisle rack)
//! on the USB-serial bus and opening their ports.
//!
//! Matching is by the device's own descriptor strings where the OS exposes them
//! (macOS/Linux), by the parent USB node on Windows (where the COM node only
//! carries the driver's strings), and by chip identity + serial scheme as a last
//! resort. vid/pid are logged but never used as the primary match.
//!
//! What identifies a device type lives in a [`DeviceProfile`]; the scan itself
//! is profile-driven, so a future device type is a new profile entry plus its
//! own server-instruction handler — the scan and the transport need no changes.
//! Every matching device is returned: several racks on separate USB ports are
//! all served, each through its own connection (see `rack_connection`).
