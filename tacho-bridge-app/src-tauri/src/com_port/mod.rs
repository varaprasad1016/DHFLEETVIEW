//! Card racks over COM (serial) ports.
//!
//! This module is intentionally a **thin wrapper**: it watches the USB-serial
//! bus for supported devices, logs connect/disconnect transitions, and bridges
//! bytes between the server and each serial port. It contains **no command/wire
//! protocol** — every command is built and interpreted by the server; the
//! client only forwards raw bytes.
//!
//! A rack is a peripheral of the application, like a PC/SC reader: it has no
//! MQTT connection of its own. Its traffic rides the application connection
//! under the `rack/<id>/...` topic prefix, where `<id>` is the device serial
//! (see `rack.rs`). Several devices are served at once: each connected rack
//! gets its own serial port, presence watch and card sessions, all keyed by
//! its rack id. Presence detection mirrors how `smart_card::sc_monitor`
//! watches for cards: a continuous monitor loop that reacts to devices
//! appearing and disappearing. There is no serial PnP notification, so we poll
//! the port list (liveness = the port is present on the bus), without speaking
//! the protocol.
//!
//! Layout:
//! - `transport` — the wire: port IO, timings, command envelope
//! - `discovery` — device profiles, finding devices on the bus, opening ports
//! - `rack` — the rack traffic of the application connection (link, requests)
//! - `cards` — per-card MQTT sessions and the per-rack presence watches
//! - `state` — the per-rack card lists shown in the UI
